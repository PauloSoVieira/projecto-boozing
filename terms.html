      <p>
        Welcome to Boozing, your trusted platform for hotel search and

        Boozing serves as an intermediary platform, enabling users to search,
        compare, and book accommodation services offered by our partner hotels.

        connection between users and the service providers.

          Review the specific terms and conditions of the chosen hotel,
          including cancellation and refund policies, prior to confirming a
          reservation.

      <h3>Cancellations and Modifications</h3>
